CIFAR 10 is a popular image dataset which consists of 60000 32x32 colour images. As a beginner, I have used this dataset to create a CNN model for image classification.

## Documentation

Jupyter notebook is used to perform this image classification.
Imported all the essential modules like,
pandas, numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib and keras.

The dataset has two parts, train dataset of 50000 32x32 and test dataset of 10000 32x32.

Using CNN, after train the model with train data got 70% accuracy in test dataset.
